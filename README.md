JDA-DiscordBot-Template

This template can be used by anyone to create their own Discord bot. 
This model can obviously be used by everyone, so as to have "immediate help", instead of having some difficulties watching videos on YouTube.
Obviously you have to read the original JDA page, so you can continue your project:
